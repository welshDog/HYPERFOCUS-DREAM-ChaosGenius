## 🎯 **FINAL LAUNCH STEPS REMAINING**

### **Phase 1: Domain & DNS Setup** 🌐
- [ ] **Purchase your domain** (e.g., chaosgenius.com, hyperfocuszone.com)
- [ ] **Configure DNS A record** to point to your server IP
- [ ] **Set up SSL certificate** (Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare)
- [ ] **Update .env.prod** with your actual domain

### **Phase 2: Go Live Commands** ⚡
Once you have your domain ready, run these commands:

```bash
# Start your production services
sudo systemctl start chaosgenius_flask
sudo systemctl start chaosgenius_discord_bot

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status chaosgenius_flask
sudo systemctl status chaosgenius_discord_bot

# View logs if needed
sudo journalctl -f -u chaosgenius_flask
```

### **Phase 3: Configure Reverse Proxy** 🔧
Set up nginx or Apache to handle SSL and forward requests to port 8000:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### **Phase 4: Social Media Integration** 📱
- [ ] **Add production API keys** to .env.prod
- [ ] **Complete Etsy OAuth** at https://yourdomain.com/auth/etsy
- [ ] **Set up TikTok Shop API** with live credentials
- [ ] **Configure Discord bot** with production token
