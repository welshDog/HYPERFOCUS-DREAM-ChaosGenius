## üé≠ SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (0-15 seconds)
**[Avatar looks directly at camera, warm smile]**

**AVATAR:** "What if I told you that being 'different' isn't a problem to fix... it's a superpower to unlock?"

**[Pause for impact, slight lean forward]**

### Problem Statement (15-35 seconds)
**AVATAR:** "For too long, neurodivergent minds‚Äîpeople with ADHD, autism, dyslexia‚Äîhave been told to 'focus differently' or 'try harder.' But what if the world just needs to understand how we *actually* work?"

**[Confident, understanding tone]**

### Solution Introduction (35-55 seconds)
**AVATAR:** "I'm building Hyperfocus Zone‚Äîthe world's first creative ecosystem designed BY neurodivergent minds, FOR neurodivergent minds. It's a physical studio in Wales where you can 3D print, create with AI, build TikTok content, and most importantly... belong."

**[Gesture to imagined space behind them]**

### Vision & Impact (55-80 seconds)
**AVATAR:** "This isn't just a makerspace. It's a movement. We're creating products that matter, building community that supports, and proving that when neurodivergent minds have the right environment... we don't just succeed. We *revolutionize*."

**[Voice builds with passion]**

### Call to Action (80-90 seconds)
**AVATAR:** "Join us. Support our crowdfunding campaign. Because the future isn't built by minds that think the same‚Äîit's built by minds that think *different*."

**[Direct eye contact, confident smile]**

### Closing (90+ seconds)
**AVATAR:** "Welcome to Hyperfocus Zone. Where weird is wonderful, and different is *powerful*."
