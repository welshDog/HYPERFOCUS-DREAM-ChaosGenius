# âœŠ Hyperfocus Manifesto

We believe:
- Every divergent mind is a creative powerhouse
- Focus should never be forced, but unlocked
- Rest is part of progress
- We build weird, and that's wonderful
- Tools are for empowering, not gatekeeping
- This space belongs to the misfits, makers, and mental health warriors
