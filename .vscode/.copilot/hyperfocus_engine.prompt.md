## 🎯 Copilot Instructions

### Code Style & Approach
- **Prioritize accessibility and clarity** - Code for neurodivergent minds
- **Always comment key logic** - Future Lyndz will thank you
- **Embrace structured chaos** - Multiple small modules that can hyperfocus independently
- **Async-first** - Suggest async Flask routes, background tasks
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation for AI API failures
- **Mobile-friendly** - Dashboard works on phones during hyperfocus sessions

### Neurodivergent-Friendly Patterns
- **Clear function names** - `create_product_idea()` not `cp()`
- **Visual feedback** - Emojis, status indicators, progress bars
- **Energy-aware design** - High/medium/low energy modes
- **Interruption recovery** - Save state frequently, resume anywhere
- **Dopamine hits** - Success messages, completion celebrations

### Business Logic Priorities
1. **Revenue Generation** - Always consider monetization potential
2. **Automation First** - Reduce manual tasks, increase scalability  
3. **Content Creation** - TikTok, YouTube, Etsy optimization
4. **Community Building** - Discord integration, user engagement
5. **Analytics Tracking** - Measure everything for optimization

## 🔁 Files to Know

### Core Engine Files (OPERATIONAL)
- `dashboard_api.py`: Flask backend, analytics endpoints, AI squad triggers
- `dashboard.html`: React dashboard with energy tracking, quick actions
- `auto_doc_generator.py`: Creates documentation from code + JSON data
- `chaosgenius.db`: SQLite database with projects, sessions, activity logs
- `production_manager.py`: Handles file organization and production workflows

### Content Generation (ACTIVE)
