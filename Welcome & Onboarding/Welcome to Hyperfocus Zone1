## 🎯 Vision
To build the world's first **neurodivergent-led creative ecosystem**—a fusion of digital tools, physical spaces, and personal support that empowers unique minds to thrive. This is more than a project—it's a **movement**.

Create a safe, inclusive, and inspiring space—online and offline—where neurodiverse individuals (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and more) can:
- Hyperfocus on what they love
- Create cool, useful things
- Learn hands-on skills (3D printing, AI, coding, editing)
- Build confidence and community

## 💡 Core Values
- Neurodiversity is a superpower
- Community over competition
- Kindness-led innovation
- Create without judgment
- Focus when you can, rest when you need
- Safe space first, always
