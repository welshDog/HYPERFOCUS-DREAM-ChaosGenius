Finally, a sensory light designed BY a neurodivergent creator FOR neurodivergent minds.

Mr. Mushroom isn't just cute (though he absolutely is) - he's specifically designed to provide the perfect amount of ambient light for:
â€¢ Hyperfocus sessions that don't strain your eyes
â€¢ Bedtime wind-down without blue light overwhelm  
â€¢ Background lighting that calms instead of distracts
â€¢ Creating your own 'hyperfocus zone' anywhere

Hand-printed in Llanelli by Lyndz (WelshDog), diagnosed ADHD creator who knows exactly what your brain needs.

Choose your vibe:
ðŸŒŸ Basic - Warm white LED (perfect for focus)
ðŸŒˆ Premium - RGB color changing with remote (match your energy!)
