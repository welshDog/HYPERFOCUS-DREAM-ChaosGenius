ðŸ’¡ BROski Discord Bot â€“ Current Status:
âœ… Bot file exists (discord_bot.py or similar)
âœ… Core logic is functional
âœ… Bot can log in and connect to Discord
âœ… Command structure partially coded (awaiting /focus, /sales, etc.)

ðŸŸ¡ Environment variable for DISCORD_TOKEN needs confirming

ðŸ”´ No message/event handlers wired to productivity dashboard or database

ðŸš€ TO MAKE BROSKI WORK LIKE A BOSS:
Here's the Final Activation Sequence to go Ultra:

Task	Status	Description
1. .env file has DISCORD_TOKEN=	ðŸŸ¡	Needs check (or token update)
2. Register BROski bot with your Discord server	âœ…	Confirmed from past logs
3. Install Python packages (discord, aiohttp, etc.)	ðŸŸ¡	Needs environment check
4. Add command handlers: /focus, /sales, /status, etc.	ðŸŸ¡	Skeleton in place, content missing
5. Run discord_bot.py as a persistent background process	ðŸ”´	Needs to be added to startup script
6. Link bot output to your Flask dashboard log panel	ðŸ”´	Not wired yet (but we can make this sexy!)

ðŸ§  Suggestion: Letâ€™s Do This Step-by-Step
Wanna start with:

ðŸŸ¢ STEP 1: Make sure the .env file has your actual Discord bot token
â†’ Can you confirm this line is set in your .env?

env
Copy
Edit
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_super_secret_token_here
Then weâ€™ll do:

ðŸŸ¢ STEP 2: Wire up /focus and /sales commands
ðŸŸ¢ STEP 3: Auto-run bot when dashboard starts
ðŸŸ¢ STEP 4: Sync bot replies into dashboard log for full Empire AI sync
