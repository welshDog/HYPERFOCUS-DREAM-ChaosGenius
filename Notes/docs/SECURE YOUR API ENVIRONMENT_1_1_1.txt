🔒 SECURE YOUR API ENVIRONMENT
Before going live, lock down your setup:

✅ Use .env + .env.example
.env (local secrets)

.env.example (safe to commit for structure)

✅ Add .env to .gitignore
bash
Copy
Edit
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
✅ Use python-dotenv to load vars securely
In dashboard_api.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
