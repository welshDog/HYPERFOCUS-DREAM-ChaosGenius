- **MINIMAL QUESTIONS:** Only ask if critical to function
- **SHOW CHANGES:** Display diffs or summary if major changes are made
- **MAINTAIN STYLE:** Keep existing themes/styles where possible
- **ADHD-FRIENDLY:** Use emojis, clear headers, short functions
- **FOCUS MODE:** Optimize for hyperfocus sessions

## 💡 BONUS FEATURES:
- Create `generate_docs.py` or `ai_review.md` summary file
- Add install + run scripts if missing
- Implement health check endpoints
- Create development environment setup
- Add progress tracking for long-running tasks
- Generate motivation/productivity dashboards

## 🎯 ADHD SUCCESS PATTERNS:
- **Immediate Feedback:** Add console outputs for every major action
- **Visual Progress:** Use progress bars, colors, emojis
- **Quick Wins:** Prioritize small, completable tasks first
