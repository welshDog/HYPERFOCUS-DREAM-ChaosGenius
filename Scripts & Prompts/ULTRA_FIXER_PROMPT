# ULTRA FIXER PROMPT

Hey bro, this is for my Hyperfocus Zone project (or another creative thing I'm building). Fix everything for me — spelling, grammar, clarity, sentence flow, formatting.

Make it sound clean and confident, but still like ME — friendly, a bit quirky, neurodivergent-powered, and not too fancy or robotic.

Help it land with people: make it hit emotionally if it's a story or pitch, or make it super clear if it's instructions or info.

Keep my vibe but level it up. Here's the text:
