Sounds like a solid lineup. I’d suggest we kick off by:

1. **Building the core framework**

   * `AgentRunner`
   * `BaseAgent` abstract class
   * CLI/webhook trigger dispatcher
   * `.hyperfocus.yml` config loader

2. **Scaffolding each agent** in `/agents/`:

   * **BusinessPlanBuilder**
   * **PitchDeckDesigner**
   * **CompetitorRadar**
   * **InvestorOutreachBot**

## Proposed next steps

```text
/
├── agents/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_agent.py
│   ├── business_plan_builder.py
│   ├── pitch_deck_designer.py
│   ├── competitor_radar.py
│   └── investor_outreach_bot.py
├── runner.py
├── cli.py
└── .hyperfocus.yml
```

* **`base_agent.py`** defines:

  ```python
  class BaseAgent(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def trigger(self, event: dict) -> bool: ...
      @abstractmethod
      def run(self, context: dict) -> Any: ...
  ```
* **`runner.py`** loads `.hyperfocus.yml`, instantiates agents, and routes events.
* **`cli.py`** converts CLI commands into events for `runner.py`.
* **`.hyperfocus.yml`** might look like:

  ```yaml
  agents:
    - module: agents.business_plan_builder
      class: BusinessPlanBuilder
    - module: agents.pitch_deck_designer
      class: PitchDeckDesigner
    - module: agents.competitor_radar
      class: CompetitorRadar
    - module: agents.investor_outreach_bot
      class: InvestorOutreachBot
  ```

### Which part shall we flesh out first?

* **A.** Core framework (runner, BaseAgent, config loader)
* **B.** BusinessPlanBuilder scaffold
* **C.** PitchDeckDesigner scaffold
* **D.** CompetitorRadar scaffold
* **E.** InvestorOutreachBot scaffold

Or dive straight into all four agent classes? Let me know which slice you’d like to wire up first!
