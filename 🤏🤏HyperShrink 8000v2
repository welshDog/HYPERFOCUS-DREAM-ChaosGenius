Here are a set of discrete **missions** that you can assign to your Agents—each one with a clear objective, deliverables, and success criteria.

---

1. **Mission: Unit-Test & CI Setup**

   * **Objective:** Ensure every feature of HyperShrink 8000 stays rock-solid.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Pytest suite covering core methods (compress, decompress, metadata, stats).
     * GitHub Actions (or equivalent) workflow that runs tests on every push.
   * **Success:** All tests pass in CI; coverage ≥ 90%.

2. **Mission: Packaging & Release**

   * **Objective:** Make HyperShrink 8000 installable and versioned.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * `pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py`) enabling `pip install .`.
     * Automated release tagging (e.g. `v8000.1.0`) and CHANGELOG.md.
   * **Success:** Published test package to TestPyPI; version command works (`hypershrink --version`).

3. **Mission: Docs & Examples**

   * **Objective:** Give users everything they need to get started.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * README with installation & CLI usage examples.
     * `/examples` folder with sample text/image files and corresponding commands.
     * Draft blog-style tutorial for `/blog-drafts`.
   * **Success:** New user can follow README and compress a sample file without extra guidance.

4. **Mission: Performance Benchmarking**

   * **Objective:** Quantify speed & compression trade-offs.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Python script that runs compressions (text, image, binary) across modes.
     * CSV (or chart) comparing time vs ratio for each mode.
   * **Success:** Clear chart/table showing LEGENDARY vs ULTRA vs FAST performance.

5. **Mission: Dockerization & CLI Polish**

   * **Objective:** Simplify deployment and enhance UX.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * `Dockerfile` building a minimal image with entrypoint.
     * Shell completion scripts for bash/zsh (`hypershrink --generate-completion`).
   * **Success:** Users can `docker run hypershrink_8000 ...` and enjoy autocompletion.

6. **Mission: Library API & Web UI**

   * **Objective:** Open up HyperShrink as a service and library.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Expose `HyperShrinkCore` in a Python package import.
     * Simple FastAPI (or Flask) app with upload/download endpoints.
   * **Success:** Third-party script can `import hypershrink` and call `compress_file()`, and the web UI accepts a drag-and-drop file.

7. **Mission: Chatbot Integration**

   * **Objective:** Bring compression to your Discord/Slack channels.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Basic bot in `/ai-builds` that listens for file uploads.
     * On upload, compresses and returns `.hfz`.
   * **Success:** In a test server, uploading a file triggers the bot and delivers the compressed version.

8. **Mission: Edge-Case & Stress Testing**

   * **Objective:** Harden HyperShrink against corrupt or huge inputs.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Test suite feeding truncated/invalid `.hfz` files, huge (>1 GB) files.
     * Automated memory and timeout checks.
   * **Success:** Graceful errors for invalid inputs; no OOM on large files.

9. **Mission: Metrics, Dashboard & Leaderboards**

   * **Objective:** Turn your stats into insight—and friendly competition.
   * **Deliverables:**

     * Jupyter notebook (or script) that reads `hypershrink_stats.json` and plots bytes-saved over time.
     * Web-page or CLI command showing “Top Compressors” XP leaderboard.
   * **Success:** Dashboard renders charts; leaderboard lists top 5 users by XP.
